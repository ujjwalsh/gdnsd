gdnsd (2.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Remove patch net-dns-remove-dnssec, addressed upstream.
  * Fix Vcs-Git to point to the package's GitHub page, instead of upstream's.
  * Bump debhelper compatibility to 11.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.1.3.

gdnsd (2.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Build-Depend on libmaxminddb >= 1.2.0. This is not strictly needed, but
    building with lower versions means that we depened on the library's
    internals which are known to not be ABI-safe with newer versions.
  * Address incompatibility with newer versions of Net::DNS (libnet-dns-perl).
    Net::DNS::RR:SIG was found in the system copy, but others like
    Net::DNS::RR:NXT were not, resulting in an FTBFS. (Closes: #830184)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.8.
  * Pass -O--dbgsym-migration to dh_strip and relax the debhelper dependency
    to ease backports.

gdnsd (2.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Falls back from F_OFD_SETLK to F_SETLK at runtime if the runtime
      environment differs from the compile-time one. (Closes: #805571)
    - Fixes incompatibilities with libmaxminddb 1.1.5.
    - Fixes reproducibility issues (embedded hostname/build date).
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.7, no changes needed.
  * Upstream is signing their releases starting with 2.2.3; add Brandon's GPG
    key to debian/upstream/signing-key.asc and adjust debian/watch to check
    for the .asc.
  * Migrate from our own -dbg package to the automatic -dbgsym package.
  * Adjust libunwind-dev's architecture set: drop ia64; add mipsel, mips64el.

gdnsd (2.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Add build-dependency on libmaxminddb-dev for GeoIP2 support.
  * Add build-dependency on libunwind-dev for stacktraces on fatals.
  * Remove build-dep on geoip-database. It was only used for running the test
    suite, which now expects specific versions of the GeoIP databases.
  * Remove XS-Testsuite header, obsolete since dpkg 1.17.11.
  * Add /var/lib/gdnsd to debian/dirs.
  * Add several security options to the systemd unit file, inherited from
    upstream's own unit file.

  * New upstream release.
    - Fixes test suite failure when building as root. (Closes: #711872)
  * Update Homepage field & watch file to point to the new homepage.
  * Add rudimentary dep8/autopkgtest test. The build-time test suite is

gdnsd (1.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fixes FTBFS on sparc64, thanks to Aurelien Jarno for the help.
    - Test suite more resilient to slow build hosts, helps with a couple of
      FTBFS on slow architectures (e.g. sh4).

    Net::DNS versions broke the internal API, gdnsd now bundles parts of 0.68
    for the test suite.
  * Switch liburcu-dev build-dependency to linux-any as it was fixed in the
    meantime.

 -- Faidon Liambotis <paravoid@debian.org>  Sat, 01 Jun 2013 18:14:02 +0300

  * Build-Depends on liburcu-dev only on the subset of architectures liburcu
    supports.
