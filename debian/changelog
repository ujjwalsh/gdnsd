  * New upstream release.
    - Fixes test suite failure when building as root. (Closes: #711872)
  * Update Homepage field & watch file to point to the new homepage.
  * Add rudimentary dep8/autopkgtest test. The build-time test suite is
    thorough enough, this makes sure the daemon starts on package install.

gdnsd (1.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fixes FTBFS on sparc64, thanks to Aurelien Jarno for the help.
    - Test suite more resilient to slow build hosts, helps with a couple of
      FTBFS on slow architectures (e.g. sh4).
  * Drop dependency on libnet-dns-perl & update debian/copyright. Newer
    Net::DNS versions broke the internal API, gdnsd now bundles parts of 0.68
    for the test suite.
  * Switch liburcu-dev build-dependency to linux-any as it was fixed in the
    meantime.
